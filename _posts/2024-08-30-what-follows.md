Slowly, you smell the dew on freshly wet ground,\
Hear the gentle rustling of early spring leaves,\
the pitter-patter of the creek,\
and the quiet chirping of distant birds.

Look up slowly and open your eyes\
to see the leaves and trees and creek lit up\
by brilliant golden glow of twilight\
drive a single tear to your left eye\
as you realise\
you do not know if what follows\
is the warm comfort of dawn\
or the freezing chill of night
