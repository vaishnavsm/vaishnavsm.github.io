&lt;p&gt;Before I begin, here are two stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Story of Phoenix&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up Phoenix for a pet project. To get my bearings, I wrote a
  few basic models, wired them together in ecto, and opened IEx to
  play around with them. I loaded a user:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;132da914-c227-46d2-a1f0-ba8cc8292065&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Accounts.User&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#   __meta__: #Ecto.Schema.Metadata&amp;lt;:loaded, &amp;quot;users&amp;quot;&amp;gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#   id: &amp;quot;132da914-c227-46d2-a1f0-ba8cc8292065&amp;quot;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#   inserted_at: ~N[2021-11-16 05:51:16],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#   rooms: #Ecto.Association.NotLoaded&amp;lt;association :rooms is not loaded&amp;gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#   updated_at: ~N[2021-11-16 05:51:16],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#   username: &amp;quot;user&amp;quot;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#   ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# &amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh, that &lt;code&gt;#Ecto.Association.NotLoaded&lt;/code&gt; bit stuck out to me. Of
  course, even Rails does that, so I wasn&amp;#8217;t surprised. But I wanted to
  know how Ecto would handle me trying use it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rooms&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#Ecto.Association.NotLoaded&amp;lt;association :rooms is not loaded&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What? No magic loading, no figuring out what I want and bending to
  submit to it? In Rails, if I loaded a user and then tried to use a
  association, it would automatically run a query and fill that relation
  in, ready for use. I wondered why the Ecto struct even had that
  field, so I looked it up: if you want to use association fields, you
  &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to preload them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What&lt;/i&gt;, I thought to myself. If there were two classes (not in the
  programming sense) of the User struct - one with the relations
  preloaded and one not - that meant that I could never unambiguously
  reason about a User struct I received without strongly tied
  context. Therefore, I would have to make two types of functions -
  ones that expected the relation to be present, and ones that
  didn&amp;#8217;t - and let the caller figure out which one to call. That&amp;#8217;s
  insane, who would do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Story of Rails&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve professionally worked on a Rails service for two years, and
  even since then I&amp;#8217;ve loved using it whenever I wanted to make an
  app. With Rails (and now, Turbo), I can simply build something,
  deploy it on a cheap machine and use it from anywhere without having
  to think about frontends or app distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I&amp;#8217;ve worked on Rails professionally, I&amp;#8217;ve also had to face
  a variety of situations that come from large scale use. One time, a
  User complained that some flows on our app were sluggish, so we
  profiled our performance to figure out why they were so slow.
  Eventually, we found that in many cases, we were gathering and
  serializing &lt;i&gt;way&lt;/i&gt; too much data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t reproduce the actual details, but consider a &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; model
  that has a bunch of associations and some properties that are
  calculated based on them. We found out that our default endpoint
  was calculating too many things that weren&amp;#8217;t actually useful for
  some use cases. This included properties that required, say, a
  heavy SQL query or expensive calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve this, we broke apart the use cases where the client would
  want this data, and wrote specific endpoints for them. In these
  endpoints, we only ever calculated things that were &lt;i&gt;required&lt;/i&gt;, and
  sometimes that meant using every trick in the ActiveRecord book.
  For example, we used &lt;code&gt;select&lt;/code&gt; to load only specific fields from a
  join and receive an object we could get &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; those specific
  fields from. For example, you can do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user_rooms&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;joins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:rooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;user.id AS user_id, rooms.id AS room_id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user_rooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# =&amp;gt; only has the properties user_id and room_id.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the methods we wrote that worked on these objects could
  only ever work with them, as they weren&amp;#8217;t your usual records. So we
  marked those methods clearly with documentation to be clear about
  the preconditions of these functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, we wrote a bunch of functions that operated on specific
  classes of records where we couldn&amp;#8217;t reason about the data we got
  without strongly tied context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Data Oriented Programming&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc&quot;&gt;talk on &amp;#8220;Data-Oriented Design and C++&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;, Mike Acton speaks of
  three lies about programming that have become norm in the community
  and three corresponding truths to correct those beliefs. If you
  haven&amp;#8217;t watched that talk yet, go on, watch it now. It&amp;#8217;s far more
  insightful than anything I can tell you, and whether you agree with
  his approach or not it&amp;#8217;s a useful idea to have in your toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a bit weird to consider that talk in the context of a slow,
  interpreted and garbage collected language, especially since a lot
  of the talk is about hardware and cache lines and so on. But I think
  there are few takeaways that apply universally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At its core, every program is a transfromation of data from one
    form to another.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;That means the &lt;b&gt;data&lt;/b&gt; is the core of the program.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therefore, the code and how we model it is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; more important
    than data - it should be the other way around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the talk, he goes on to dissect an issue with an Object
  Oriented game engine, and in one example he specifically points out
  that a class was written with no concern to who would be &lt;i&gt;reading&lt;/i&gt;
  the data. This, I think, is the most important conclusion that
  follows from the three takeaways above: you should always be
  considering who will be reading the data you load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;ActiveRecord&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love ActiveRecord. Especially when I was just cutting my teeth in
  web development, ActiveRecord made it super easy to reason about my
  data model. And when I grew more and more experienced and wanted
  more specific outcomes, I could always use AR as a query builder and
  dip into Arel to make queries that were not brittle to data model
  changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the problem with ActiveRecord is &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; that it privileges
  your understanding of code over data. This is a billed feature of
  ORMs: you get to avoid having to think of your data as pesky rows,
  and you instead have pristine objects with all the joy of how you&amp;#8217;ve
  modelled them in your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most frequent issue that comes out of this is what I&amp;#8217;ve
  heard described as &amp;#8220;seeing stars&amp;#8221; - most common interactions in AR
  involve loading &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; field of your record, even if you don&amp;#8217;t need
  them all. I can&amp;#8217;t even keep count of the number of times I casually
  loaded a bunch of records, and used maybe one or two methods on them
  or used them just to load a relation. This gets worse when you want
  to load a bunch of records and their associations - by default, the
  Rails tool for this is &lt;code&gt;includes&lt;/code&gt; - and it loads every field of the
  parent records &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; of the associations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#8217;s not just about loading fields. If I get a &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; object and
  mindlessly access an association on it, AR will helpfully load it,
  and in the process often cause an N+1 query. Basically, AR&amp;#8217;s ease of
  use and privileging of your objects over the data you need hides two
  important facts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You&amp;#8217;re hitting an &lt;i&gt;edge&lt;/i&gt; of your system. To get data, you need to
    go out of your Ruby process, and reach into your database. This
    is very, very slow (relatively, of course).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You don&amp;#8217;t &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; objects, you need data. Often the data you want
    is across tables - and therefore, across objects - so in the AR
    world, by default, you must load lots of objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s easy to see why AR does this. If you&amp;#8217;re a Ruby programmer, you
  reason in objects, and therefore it&amp;#8217;s easier for you to think &amp;#8220;this
  is what I must do to these objects to get what I want&amp;#8221;. This is the
  thinking that led to the &amp;#8220;Fat Models&amp;#8221; approach, where you fill your
  model classes with methods that operate on its properties based on
  your business logic. But that&amp;#8217;s exactly the problem: you&amp;#8217;re tying
  your data processing to the &lt;i&gt;objects&lt;/i&gt;, not the data. The key issue
  here - everywhere - is that you&amp;#8217;re never thinking about where and
  why you&amp;#8217;re reading data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, as we did when we ran into this issue, you can &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt;
  make AR work as a query builder and load only specific fields, and
  many Rails programmers are doing that! But the issue with AR &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; that
  you don&amp;#8217;t realize it&amp;#8217;s a problem: its helpfulness is a poisoned
  chalice, keeping you from thinking about usage until you get to a
  breaking point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Ecto&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecto, the database access layer bundled in Phoenix, isn&amp;#8217;t an ORM,
  not least because Elixir is a functional language and doesn&amp;#8217;t have
  objects. It doesn&amp;#8217;t solve all the problems I mention here - you&amp;#8217;re
  still often thinking about &lt;i&gt;structs&lt;/i&gt; intead of &lt;i&gt;objects&lt;/i&gt; - but the
  thing that makes all the difference to me is that by virtue of being
  functional, Ecto makes you think a lot more about the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examples I posted at the beginning of this post show that - if
  you want to load an association, you have to do it manually, and
  therefore you&amp;#8217;re more considerate of whether you need it or
  not. Ecto makes you painfully aware that you&amp;#8217;re hitting an edge of
  your app, and if you load less data than you actually need now
  you&amp;#8217;ll have to hit that edge again later. So you&amp;#8217;re now thinking
  about the reader. How much data does the reader need? What fields do
  I need?  Maybe I don&amp;#8217;t need to preload the association, and I can
  load just data in my query?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this &amp;#8220;strongly&amp;#8221; ties your reading functions to your data
  loading functions, I think that&amp;#8217;s entirely fine - in many cases, you
  will only ever use that function in one context. So isntead of
  worryign about hypotheticals you can write tight, performant data
  pipelines for your actual uses. And in many cases, because all of
  your logic is in pure functions, if you do want to support multiple
  contexts, you can safely refactor that away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pure functions on modules instead of methods on objects also
  mean that you don&amp;#8217;t even need structs - you can take naked ids or
  just properties, do your calculations and return. This allow you to
  write code that&amp;#8217;s much more driven by the data than how you&amp;#8217;ve
  modelled it. &lt;i&gt;And&lt;/i&gt;, when you refactor processing logic out of data
  fetching logic, you can write functions that operate just on the
  properties you want, making you even more aware of the data you
  read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, Ecto is primarily a query builder, with a powerful and elegant
  syntax for writing queries. I&amp;#8217;ve never bought the argument against
  query builders, that they hide SQL from you - I think good query
  builders allow you to basically write SQL while shielding you from
  the harms and annoyances, like SQL injection or moving data between
  your programming language and SQL. Even while using AR I learned a
  lot of SQL simply by optimizing the AR queries I wrote, and I think
  ecto is even better at giving you all the power of SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I find how much I&amp;#8217;m moving away from AR and towards
  query builders like Ecto kind of funny. ORMs have been described as
  the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.tedneward.com/post/the-vietnam-of-computer-science/&quot;&gt;Vietnam of Computer Science&lt;/a&gt; - but perhaps a better analogy would
  be history itself: every passing generation is doomed to fall in
  love with ORMs, and then rediscover the painful lessons of using
  them. I know I have.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Shrikanth Upadhayaya</name></author><category term="elixir" /><category term="phoenix" /><category term="rails" /><category term="dod" /><summary type="html">Two Stories Before I begin, here are two stories.

I&amp;#8217;ve been planning to write a blog for a while - I&amp;#8217;ve
  usually got more than a few thoughts kicking around in my head that
  would do me better if I wrote them down somewhere - but I think I&amp;#8217;ve
  finally found a good reason to kick start it: advent of code and roc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What&amp;#8217;s Roc?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.roc-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Roc&lt;/a&gt; is a new and not yet released functional programming
  language. If you look at it purely from a syntax/features point of
  view, you might not find anything interesting about it, but I invite
  you to check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpQwtwVKAfU&quot;&gt;this talk&lt;/a&gt; by its creator, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rtfeldman&quot;&gt;Richard Feldman.&lt;/a&gt; I
  think it goes into a lot of what made Roc stand out for me, namely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The philosophy of &amp;#8220;platforms&amp;#8221;, which allows you to change &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt;
    your code interacts with the rest of the world. Want a
    high-performance server implementation? Write the low-level IO in
    rust and plug in the logic in Roc. The advantage of this approach
    is that you can use &amp;#8220;the right tool for the job&amp;#8221;, and even go so
    far as to create a platform for a game or an app that allows
    users to safely script in Roc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A focus on performance: Roc is tapping into cutting edge research
    to make functional programming with immutable data structures
    almost as fast as writing low level procedural code. Don&amp;#8217;t
    believe me? &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/vzfy4EKwG_Y&quot;&gt;Watch this.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pure FP with effects and structural typing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why Roc?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure all I&amp;#8217;ve mentioned so far would&amp;#8217;ve at least piqued your
  interest if you like functional programming, as it did to me when I
  first learned about Roc. But while Roc is promising, it is not yet
  &lt;i&gt;ready&lt;/i&gt;. As the website mentions, Roc is still under development,
  and definitely isn&amp;#8217;t production-ready. The compiler is still in its
  early stages and in my first time messing around with roc code I ran
  into some pretty inscrutable compiler errors, including a bug which
  led to my code not even printing &amp;#8220;Hello, world!&amp;#8221; until I added an
  &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; &lt;i&gt;somewhere&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all fine and expected for a language that&amp;#8217;s so early in its
  development, but why use it for advent of code? Well, the biggest
  reason is that working with a very new language without the mature
  stdlib or ecosystem of a Java or even F# is that it&amp;#8217;s a super
  interesting challenge. In preparationf or this year&amp;#8217;s advent of
  code, I did a few of last year&amp;#8217;s challenges in F#, and in most cases
  I got the correct answer by wrangling together &lt;code&gt;File.ReadLines&lt;/code&gt;,
  regexes and &lt;code&gt;Seq&lt;/code&gt; functions. It almost felt like cheating. Here&amp;#8217;s
  one of my solutions in F#:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;INPUT_PATH&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ReadLines&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Seq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mapi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;currentIndex&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;currentIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Seq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;#&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Seq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;printfn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;%d&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely can&amp;#8217;t do that in Roc, if only because proper support
  for File I/O in the CLI platform is just coming into shape. Writing
  more low-level code in a functional langauge is exactly the kind of
  challenge I want to take up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to stress testing the roc
  compiler as a user: What went wrong? What was I expecting? Why did
  it not work that way? and reporting it to the team so they can make
  it better. Heck, this might be what finally gets me into the depths
  of compilers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What&amp;#8217;s coming?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll &lt;i&gt;try&lt;/i&gt; to solve each AoC challenge on the day it comes out, but
  due to work and so on I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;ll be able to meet that
  goal. I&amp;#8217;ll definitely catch up to the ones I&amp;#8217;ve missed over the
  weekends. Additionally, I&amp;#8217;ll try to write a blog post for each
  solution where I had challenges with roc more than with the logic of
  the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;#8217;s it for now. We&amp;#8217;re off to the races!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Shrikanth Upadhayaya</name></author><category term="aoc" /><category term="roc" /><category term="fp" /><category term="programming" /><summary type="html">Hello there! I&amp;#8217;ve been planning to write a blog for a while - I&amp;#8217;ve usually got more than a few thoughts kicking around in my head that would do me better if I wrote them down somewhere - but I think I&amp;#8217;ve finally found a good reason to kick start it: advent of code and roc. What&amp;#8217;s Roc? Roc is a new and not yet released functional programming language. If you look at it purely from a syntax/features point of view, you might not find anything interesting about it, but I invite you to check out this talk by its creator, Richard Feldman. I think it goes into a lot of what made Roc stand out for me, namely: The philosophy of &amp;#8220;platforms&amp;#8221;, which allows you to change how your code interacts with the rest of the world. Want a high-performance server implementation? Write the low-level IO in rust and plug in the logic in Roc. The advantage of this approach is that you can use &amp;#8220;the right tool for the job&amp;#8221;, and even go so far as to create a platform for a game or an app that allows users to safely script in Roc. A focus on performance: Roc is tapping into cutting edge research to make functional programming with immutable data structures almost as fast as writing low level procedural code. Don&amp;#8217;t believe me? Watch this. Pure FP with effects and structural typing. Why Roc? I&amp;#8217;m sure all I&amp;#8217;ve mentioned so far would&amp;#8217;ve at least piqued your interest if you like functional programming, as it did to me when I first learned about Roc. But while Roc is promising, it is not yet ready. As the website mentions, Roc is still under development, and definitely isn&amp;#8217;t production-ready. The compiler is still in its early stages and in my first time messing around with roc code I ran into some pretty inscrutable compiler errors, including a bug which led to my code not even printing &amp;#8220;Hello, world!&amp;#8221; until I added an await somewhere. This is all fine and expected for a language that&amp;#8217;s so early in its development, but why use it for advent of code? Well, the biggest reason is that working with a very new language without the mature stdlib or ecosystem of a Java or even F# is that it&amp;#8217;s a super interesting challenge. In preparationf or this year&amp;#8217;s advent of code, I did a few of last year&amp;#8217;s challenges in F#, and in most cases I got the correct answer by wrangling together File.ReadLines, regexes and Seq functions. It almost felt like cheating. Here&amp;#8217;s one of my solutions in F#: INPUT_PATH |&amp;gt; File.ReadLines |&amp;gt; Seq.mapi (fun idx line -&amp;gt; let currentIndex = idx * 3 % String.length line line.[currentIndex]) |&amp;gt; Seq.filter (fun ch -&amp;gt; ch = &amp;#39;#&amp;#39;) |&amp;gt; Seq.length |&amp;gt; printfn &amp;quot;%d&amp;quot; I definitely can&amp;#8217;t do that in Roc, if only because proper support for File I/O in the CLI platform is just coming into shape. Writing more low-level code in a functional langauge is exactly the kind of challenge I want to take up!

Here, you can catch up on stuff we&amp;#8217;ve been toying
  with, what we&amp;#8217;ve learned in the process and stuff that, hopefully, you
  can take away something from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Details&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is currently hosted on github pages CNAMED to our
  domain. We try to make website completely usable without any
  javascript; if you notice issues with javascript disabled, please let
  us know. Comments are via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/giscus/giscus&quot;&gt;giscus&lt;/a&gt;, and require javascript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our stack uses jekyll, with our theme being forked from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rahul-bothra/parchment&quot;&gt;parchment&lt;/a&gt;. Our
  choice of jekyll was motivated by its extensibility and our prior
  experience with ruby. Since the two of us write in different formats
  (markdown and org mode, for example) we couldn&amp;#8217;t go with a system that
  didn&amp;#8217;t at least support the two, and hugo wasn&amp;#8217;t a good fit for us
  since we&amp;#8217;re not as comfortable maintaining templates in its syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What&amp;#8217;s coming?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the near future, we&amp;#8217;ll be writing on Phoenix and Kotlin
  Multiplatform, and beyond that wherever our technical adventures take
  us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s it for now. Before we leave, here&amp;#8217;s a funny snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
